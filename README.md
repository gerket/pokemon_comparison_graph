# tng_heroku_app

This is a small project that demonstrates Flask and python apps online by using a multi-select dropdown box along with a dynamically updating graph. It incorporates pandas, API calls, and plotly.  

A potentially more updated version of this app is at [https://github.com/gerket/pokemon_graph](https://github.com/gerket/pokemon_graph) That app is deployed at [pokemon-graph.herokuapp.com](pokemon-graph.herokuapp.com). It may be a little slow due to heroku or the api (which limits the number of calls) but it works well locally.
